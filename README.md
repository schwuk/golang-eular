Project Euler solutions in Go
-----------------------------

As an experiment to help me learn [Go](golang.org), I plan to work through the problems in [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) and solve each one in Go.

Since I'm fairly new to Go, and my preferred language is [Python](http://www.python.org/), I'll be working out my solutions first in Python before implementing the solutions (or re-solving) in Go.

My Python solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/schwuk/python-euler).

Since the whole point of Project Euler is to learn by doing, I don't recommend you use this project to short cut your solutions, but the choice is yours.
